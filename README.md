## Introduction
This project primarily focuses on the goal of developing a programming language specifically catered to automating smart home devices and constructing a compiler to translate that language into executable commands.
Our objective for the project is not to fully implement a solution that support all brands and types of smart devices. 
Instead, we aim to demonstrate a proof-of-concept that validates the feasibility of our proposed approach.

## Prerequisites
``Java >= 19``

``Maven >= 3.8.6``

The project was developed using Java 19 and Maven 3.8.6, but has not been tested with older version.

## Building & running
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in IDE of your choice.
3. Modify the ``Main.iota`` for desired smart home automation(s).
4. Build the project using Maven.
5. Run the project.
